  summary: A Python library to conjugate French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian verbs using Machine Learning techniques.
  license: MIT
  license_file: LICENSE
  description: |
    A Command Line application and Python library to conjugate verbs in French, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian (more soon) using Machine Learning techniques.

    Conjugate any verb in one of the supported languages, even completely new or made-up verbs, with the help of a pre-trained Machine Learning model.
    The pre-trained models are composed of a binary feature extractor, a feature selector using Linear Support Vector Classification, and a classifier using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
    Easily modify and retrain the models using any compatible classifiers from scikit-learn.
    Uses Verbiste as the training data for the French model, and unsupervised learning techniques to generate the data for the English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian models.

    Usage
    =====

    > **note**
    >
    > The default language is French.
    > :   When called without specifying a language, the library will try to
    >     conjugate the verb in French.

    To use MLConjug3 from the command line:

        $ mlconjug3 manger

        $ mlconjug3 bring -l en

        $ mlconjug3 gallofar --language es

        $ mlconjug3 -o, --output (Path of the filename for storing the conjugation tables.)

        $ mlconjug3 -s, --subject (The subject format type for the conjugated forms). The
                           values can be 'abbrev' or 'pronoun'. The default value
                           is 'abbrev'.
